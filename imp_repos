Backend Projects : 
MyTop100Movies - API,Database,CRUD - Application which lets users set their top 100 movies. Movies could come from an API like The Movie Database (http://tmdb.org). Should allow for users to add a movie, list and rank their movie selections. Start with basic CRUD for movies and add features.

ScheduleMaker - Can develop the database schema or an application. Let one user define the schedule for others. Or let users select their own schedule.

Gist Clone - Requires user system(single would work). Create a system like github's Gist which allows a user to create a page from markdown syntax.
Drag And Drop Newsletter Builder - This tutorial : http://simbyone.com/drag-and-drop-newsletter-builder-using-jquery/ lacks a back end for storing newsletters. Create one to mesh with the front end.
College Scoreboard - data.gov provides a 'college scoreboard' API. Use this API to build a site where users can select various schools in their area. https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/college-scorecard


Simple CRUD sites - Create, Read,Update,Delete (read includes list). Possible 'objects' could be Dog Breeds, any type of pet, plants, flowers etc. Level of detail is up to you. Locations like Museums, National Parks. Events like music festivals is another possibility. Data Model sample for Events : http://www.databaseanswers.org/data_models/enterprise_data_model_for_events_and_exhibitions/index.htm
RESTful API - use the same list from the CRUD sites but make it available as an API.
Build some Data Models - People of importance or historical, whichever you like. Can use http://databaseanswers.org as a starting point with people and citizen data models : http://www.databaseanswers.org/data_models/people.htm , http://www.databaseanswers.org/data_models/citizens/index.htm
GistList - Frontend and simple. Make a javascript application to work with the github Gist API to display all of a user's gist with links. Could add ability to sort or filter. https://developer.github.com/v3/gists/ for the API docs and could use vue.js for filtering using this intro to vue.js : https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1755&v=VPUdtEf3oXI
File Directory - Provide an admin user with the ability to upload files for the public. Like PDFs, Word Docs, whatever. Can be simple or advanced. (Comparable but more useful IMO than FreeCodeCamp's File Metadata Microservice : https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/file-metadata-microservice)
Image Search - FreeCodeCamp calls this Image Search Abstraction Layer which sounds complicated. Instead of interfacing with a 3rd party, make it search a defined path on the local file system. FCC's description : https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/image-search-abstraction-layer
Time API - One more from FCC : https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/timestamp-microservice make this available as an API and add options like setting the Time Zone.
Workflow Application - Design a system which requires interaction between users. Simplest example would be author > editor with the object being passed is an article. Author submits article, editor approves or rejects it. Can find other examples of this type of process in other fields.
Simple Property Rentals - Application for single user to offer rental properties. Database model, multiple CRUD objects and make it self hosted.
Database Model/Schema - Go to http://databaseanswers.org, pick a model and convert it to MySQL.
SVG Floor Plan - Front end, but use SVG to create a floor plan layout type application.
