Backend Projects : 
MyTop100Movies - API,Database,CRUD - Application which lets users set their top 100 movies. Movies could come from an API like The Movie Database (http://tmdb.org). Should allow for users to add a movie, list and rank their movie selections. Start with basic CRUD for movies and add features.

ScheduleMaker - Can develop the database schema or an application. Let one user define the schedule for others. Or let users select their own schedule.

Gist Clone - Requires user system(single would work). Create a system like github's Gist which allows a user to create a page from markdown syntax.
